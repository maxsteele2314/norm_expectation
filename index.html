  Cairo: Norm vs. Expectation
  </h1>
  
  <p>
   The process of visually exploring data is summarized by Cairo: find patterns and trends lurking in the data and then observe the
   deviations from those patterns. A norm is a model of what should exist or be followed or is the average model that is selcted in
   a given context. An exception is an unplanned event that occurs while a program is executing and disrupts the flow of its 
   instructions. Both of these terms refer to the visually displayed aspects of a given data set. Whether that is how the numbers 
   are displayed, the text is displayed or even what type of chart is selected.
